This project shows how to lauch a production grade application to AWS EC2. It is a simple flask application, with the following features:
- ***A User Registration System.***
- ***A User Authentication and Authorization System.***
- ***A User Creation System.***
- ***Uses the PostgresQL Database to store both users as well as authentication and authorization information.***
- ***A logging system that logs to file and sends emails on critical errors.***
- ***It is deployed to an AWS EC2 instance with gunicorn server and nginx as a proxy.***

If you want to learn more about how it was developed, read ***[How to Deploy a Containerized Flask Application to Heroku using GitHub Actions](https://medium.com/@lyle-okoth/how-to-deploy-a-containerized-flask-application-to-heroku-using-github-actions-b0353880afc6)***. 

The are atleast five branches associated with the application:

- **Features** - Used to create new features
- **Development** - Where all the newly developed features are showcased
- **Staging** - Used to test out the nwely developed features before being moved to production
- **Release** - Holds all the code and assets related to the latest release
- **Production** - Holds all the code that is currentlyin production.

**The application development workflow. **

- A new feature branch is created, to host the code for the new feature.
- When this is pushed to GitHub, it triggers a workflow that does code quality checks as well as run unit tests, then tests that the application does run.
- When the feature branch is merged into the development branch, the same code quality checks are run. In addition , the code is pushed to the development server and then the application is restarted with the changes.
- The development branch is merged into the staging branch, following the same workflow, but the code is autodeployed to a staging server.
- When a tag is pushed to GitHub, the staging branch is merged into the Release branch and a release is created.
- When the rellease branch is merged into the production branch, the code is pushed to the production server and the production application restarted with the changes.

**The application routes.** 

The API has nine routes.

| Route       | Method      | Description      |
| ----------- | ----------- |----------------- |
| '/'         | GET         | Get the home page |
| '/user'     | GET         | Get a single user by supplying an ID |
| '/user'     | POST        | Create a new user by supplying the email address |
| '/user'     | PUT         | Update a single user's data by supplying the user ID and email address |
| '/user'     | DELETE      | Delete a single user by supplying the users ID |
| '/users'    | GET         | Get the list of all created users |
| '/auth/register'     | POST         | Register a new user. |
| '/auth/login'     | POST         | Login a registered user to get an access token. |
| '/auth/me'     | GET         | Get a logged in user's data. |

**The default (/) route :**

```json
{
  "hello": "from the template api!"
}
```

**The /users route :**

```json
[
  {
    "active": true, 
    "email": "test@example.com", 
    "id": 1
  }, 
  {
    "active": true, 
    "email": "test1@example.com", 
    "id": 2
  }
]
```
**The /user route :**

```json
{
    "active": true, 
    "email": "test@example.com", 
    "id": 1
 }
```
